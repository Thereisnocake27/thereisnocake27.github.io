                      I dreaded this class.

                      During my career as a high school English student I developed a deep-seated loathing for the standard 5 paragraph essay, so when I found out that I had to take a class dedicated to writing essays I was rather dejected. Furthermore, I was rather unsure of my ability as a writer due to many of my papers receiving poor grades. At the time I was still unsure if my poor English grades throughout high school were a result of my lack of writing skills, or a lack of interest (and by extension lack of effort).

                    <p>
                      My struggle with this class began with the first assignment: a simple quick-write about our writing processes. This seems like it would be simple, right...? I very quickly realized that I don’t have a writing process, and that I would need to develop one to survive in this class (and through college as a whole)

                      So I began setting goals.

                        Get atleast 80% on every assignment.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Miss no more than 2 lectures.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Figure out my writing process.
                      </li>

                      My three simple goals. While they may be nothing grand (or even exciting at all really), they do help me move towards achieving my overall goal. My overall goal is to survive in college (and by extension this class).

                            Over the course of this term, I have been working hard towards achieving my goals. It has been rather challenging at times, but trying my best and struggling has helped me discover some areas for improvement. I have began working on improving my time management skills, my punctuality, and my actual writing skills. I now try and sit down and start working on assignments 5 days before they are due. My increased attendance (in comparison to high school) has better helped me understand the material and further develop my writing skills.
